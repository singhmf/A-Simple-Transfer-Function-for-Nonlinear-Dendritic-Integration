# A-Simple-Transfer-Function-for-Nonlinear-Dendritic-Integration
Instructions and Code from Singh &amp; Zald (2015)

These MATLAB files will allow users to compute the expected peak somatic EPSP due to dendritic stimulation. Components consist of passive currents subject to spatio/temporal decay and active NMDAR-mediated currents. The file DendTranInstructions gives detailed instructions on implementing the code and its function. The master function is DendTran and the supporting functions are SigZ (the soft boundary), Spike (NMDA spike amplitude), and LengthMat (spatio/temporal decay matrix).
